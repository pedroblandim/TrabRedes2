Git was created by the main Linux developer, Linus Towards.
The development of Linux was possible due the git existence.
As the Linux is a community software, it means, it was created by people working together, it required a way to bring everyone together. That`s git. 

So, Joaozinho, we are gonna use that to. 



That`s the commands used for common things.

 * git add --all (add changes to the accepted changes area)
 * git commit -m "some description" (add a new version to repository history from accepted changes)
